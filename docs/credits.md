# Credits
- [developit](https://github.com/developit) by basically programming this library and making it possible without even knowing. He provided [this untested document implementation](https://github.com/staydecent/nativescript-preact/issues/4#issuecomment-323900569) which is the most important core part of this library. He also authored [undom](https://github.com/developit/undom) from which some document mock code was borrowed. And he also authored [preact](https://github.com/developit/preact) without which this wouldn't even be possible.
- [staydecent](https://github.com/staydecent) for providing [a code example](https://github.com/staydecent/nativescript-preact) that showed that preact-to-nativescript is not impossible wizardry but achievable by writing the right wrapper
