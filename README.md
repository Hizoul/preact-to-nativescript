# preact-to-nativescript
## This Library is experimental!

Building upon [this document implementation](https://github.com/staydecent/nativescript-preact/issues/4#issuecomment-323900569) [by developit](https://github.com/developit) preact-to-nativescript simulates a web document similar to [undom](https://github.com/developit/undom) that enables preact to render to NativeScript

## TBD
- Docs
- Handle Navigation via Nativescripts API (custom routing in pure js works fine though!)
- ActionBar Known Limitations
  - SystemIcon is not respected
  - NavigationButton doesn't properly render
